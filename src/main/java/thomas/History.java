/**
 * What it would take to reverse each change made to the task list this session.
 * <p>
 * Every command that changes the list records the reverse of what it did, and
 * {@code undo} applies the most recent such record. Recording the reverse rather
 * than a copy of the whole list is what makes many undos cheap: a step is a
 * number and a reference, not a second list.
 * <p>
 * A command that changes nothing records nothing, so {@code list}, {@code find}
 * and {@code on} are passed over without having to be told to be -- and a command
 * that fails records nothing either, since a step is pushed only after the change
 * it reverses has actually happened.
 * <p>
 * Steps are applied strictly last in, first out, and {@link #undo(TaskList)} is
 * the only way to reach one. That is what makes every number a step carries
 * valid at the moment it is replayed: the list is necessarily back in the state
 * it was in when the step was recorded. Nothing here therefore reports a bad
 * number to the user; a bad number would be a mistake in the code, and is
 * asserted against instead.
 * <p>
 * The history lives in memory and dies with the program. It is deliberately not
 * saved: it would be a second file format to keep correct in the one place where
 * a mistake silently loses tasks, for a convenience that is only ever wanted
 * within the session that earned it.
