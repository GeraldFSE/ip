 * The tasks the chatbot is keeping, and the operations over them.

 * only be changed through the operations below. That is what lets the
 * user-facing rules live here instead of being repeated by every caller: a task
 * number the user typed is checked against the list that actually exists before
 * anything indexes into it.
 * <p>
 * Two numbering schemes meet in this class, so each accessor says in its name
 * which one it takes. {@link #get(int)} takes a position counting from 0, as
 * {@code ArrayList} does, and is for walking the list. {@link #getByNumber(int)}
 * and {@link #deleteByNumber(int)} take the number the user sees, counting from
 * 1, and are for carrying out commands. Conversion between the two happens here
 * and nowhere else.
