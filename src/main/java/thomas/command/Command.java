/**
 * One command, understood and ready to be carried out.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Command} is built by {@link Parser} from a line the user typed, with
 * whatever arguments that command takes already read and checked. Carrying it
 * out is then {@link #execute} -- so the work of understanding a line and the
 * work of doing what it asks are separated, and neither has to be read to
 * follow the other.
 * <p>
 * Each command is its own subclass rather than a branch of a switch. What that
 * buys is that everything about a command sits in one file: {@link Thomas} asks
 * for a command and runs it without knowing which one it got, and adding a new
 * one means writing a class rather than editing the loop that runs them all.
 * <p>
 * The three collaborators are handed to {@link #execute} rather than held as
 * fields, because a command is built fresh for every line and would otherwise
 * carry three references it uses once. It also keeps plain what each command is
 * allowed to touch: the tasks, the screen, and the save file.
